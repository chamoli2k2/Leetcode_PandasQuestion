        "\n",
        "A **DataFrame** is a versatile and efficient data structure offered by the pandas library. It resembles a 2D table, much like a spreadsheet or SQL table. In this structure, each row represents an individual record, while each column represents a distinct attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this solution is to transform a 2D list into a pandas DataFrame. This is a common application of the pandas library when you have raw data in list format and want to convert it into a more structured, labeled format for simplified analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **2D List**: A list of lists in which each inner list represents a row of data.\n",
        "- **DataFrame**: A 2-dimensional labeled data structure provided by pandas for structured data handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing pandas**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   To utilize pandas, start by importing the library:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   import pandas as pd\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This line imports pandas and assigns it the alias 'pd'. Pandas is known for its swift, flexible, and expressive data structures designed for structured data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Function Definition**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Define a function named `createDataframe` that accepts a 2D list, `student_data`, as an argument, and returns a pandas DataFrame:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using pd.DataFrame()**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Transform the `student_data` 2D list into a DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame()` function:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   pd.DataFrame(student_data)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   The resulting DataFrame will contain default headers labeled as 0 and 1, created automatically using integer indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Custom Column Names** (Optional):\n",
        "\n",
        "   If you want to define custom column names, you can do so using the `columns` parameter. Create a list of column names in the desired order and provide it as a parameter to `pd.DataFrame()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   column_names = [\"student_id\", \"age\"]\n",
        "   pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=column_names)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This approach allows you to assign meaningful names to your DataFrame columns.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Using the shape attribute:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Every DataFrame in pandas has a shape attribute. When you call it, it returns a tuple (number of rows, number of columns). In our case, for the given players DataFrame, the shape would be (10, 5) because there are 10 players and 5 attributes for each player.\n",

        "4. **The Function:**\n",

        "\n",
        "This problem involves working with a pandas DataFrame, a 2D table-like structure used to manage data. The task at hand requires us to extract specific information from the DataFrame, particularly details about one student's record.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **DataFrame**: A DataFrame is a 2D tabular data structure in pandas, where each row represents a distinct record, and each column signifies different attributes or features. It's versatile, adjustable, and ideal for managing heterogeneous data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **loc Attribute**: The `.loc` attribute is a primary method for selecting data from a DataFrame. It is label-based, which means you specify the row or column names to access data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Boolean Mask**: A Boolean mask is a sequence of True/False values that serve as a filter or selector for elements in another data structure, like a list, array, or DataFrame. It's employed to isolate data based on specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided DataFrame, \"students,\" consists of three columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **student_id** (data type: int): A unique identifier for each student.\n",
        "- **name** (data type: object, typically a string): The name of the student.\n",
        "- **age** (data type: int): The age of the student.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our task involves creating a function that takes the DataFrame as an input and returns a new DataFrame with specific information. We will utilize the `.loc` function inside our function to select the row where the \"student_id\" is 101 and extract the values in the \"name\" and \"age\" columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a step-by-step overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Import the pandas library: `import pandas as pd`\n",
        "2. Define the function as follows:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def selectStudentData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
        "       return students.loc[students['student_id'] == 101, ['name', 'age']]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this function, we employ `.loc` to filter the DataFrame based on the condition that the \"student_id\" is equal to 101. We specify the columns 'name' and 'age' that we want to retrieve from the matching row.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result will be a new DataFrame containing the name and age of the student with a \"student_id\" of 101.\n",

        "- **pandas Series:** a one-dimensional data structure provided by the pandas library. A Series can be thought of as a column of data in a pandas DataFrame.

        "- **column-wise operations:** operations that can be performed on each individual element in a DataFrame Series. A few examples of types of column-wise operations are arithmetic operations, aggregate functions, filtering and conditional operations, and string operations.\n",
